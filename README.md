Node Gallery
============

NodeJS Photo Gallery built on Express 4.  
Feed it a directory of photos, get back a JSON object & a styled photo gallery ready for the web.  

* No database needed
* Strictly no frills
* Folders titles => Album titles
* Image titles => Photo Titles
* EXIF title => Description
* Displays camera capture info (exposure, aperture, ISO..)

Installation
============

    $ npm install --save node-gallery
    
Usage    
=====
Node gallery can be used standalone, or in an existing node.js application. 
## Standalone
    
	// TODO Document

## Existing Application
Node Gallery exposes express style middleware, meaning it can be mounted to any route within your application.

    /*
    @param {string} staticFiles The directory where your album starts - can contain photos or images
    @param {string} urlRoot The root URL which you pass into the epxress router in app.use (no way of obtaining this otherwise)
    @param {string} title Yup, you guessed it - the title to display on the root gallery
    */
    app.use('/gallery', require('node-gallery')({
      staticFiles : 'resources/photos',
      urlRoot : 'gallery', 
      title : 'Example Gallery'
    }).middleware);


Examples
===================
A usage example using node-gallery with Express can be found in [examples/app.js](examples/app.js).

Photos
===================
Photos are added to your specified `staticFiles` directory. Albums are created for every folder we encounter, and thumbnails are automatically generated by using the first image we come across in this album.  

Tests
============
Tests are written in raw javascript. To run,

    $ npm test

ImageMagick
===========
Node Gallery does require ImageMagick. Installation instructions for mac can be found at: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#macosx  
  
For windows:

1. Select imagemagick installer for your system, e.g., http://sourceforge.net/projects/imagemagick/files/6.8.9-exes/ImageMagick-6.8.9-4-Q16-x64-dll.exe/download
2. Install imagemagick
3. Make sure that imagemagick tools are available on system path (e.g., you can test if you can run "convert.exe" from CMD)
4. Restart cygwin, CMD or whatever you use to fire up node.js
